A part of the recent algos were originally written by [djm34](https://github.com/djm34) and [alexis78](https://github.com/alexis78)

This variant was tested and built on Raspberry Pi zero 2 w and Pi 3 a+ with raspios_lite_arm64

Note: This is a CPU only based build and does not support any CUDA access or GPU accelerated mining.

With a 4 core CPU running 3 thread performance was see to be around 80kh, but ranging from 30 to 100kh.
